If the suppressed activity is 0-9% of the previous 12 months the catch-up is profiled evenly over 6 months, 10-19% over 9 months and 20%+ then profiled evenly over 12 months from 1st July.",
      "Surge: the increase in demand according to the model.",
      "Underlying: repetition of the 12 months referrals to this service up to end of February 2020 for the rest of the model horizon. This is for context only; local areas may wish to use a mixture of actual referral volumes and more sophisticated trend analysis or projections.",
