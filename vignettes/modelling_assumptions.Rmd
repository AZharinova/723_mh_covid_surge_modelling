This document describes the nature of the open source covid-19 mental health surge model developed by the [Strategy Unit][su]. The model code can be found on [GitHub][gh] and the interactive application can be found [here][app]. 

We welcome contributions and suggestions, but cannot promise to incorporate all in future iterations. You can contact
us on our [website][su_contact].

## Modelling approach 

![Example of a single pathway](model-pathway.jpg "Model Pathway")

Our whole population simulation model is based on a system dynamics approach. The stocks in our model represent a) population risk groups exposed to covid-19 either directly or indirectly; b) the buckets of conditions/symptoms they may develop; c) the services that they may present to and receive treatment from. You can read more in `vignette("model")`. 

Initial population stocks have been derived from multiple open access, routine datasets or estimated from contemporaneous literature <<host Alex’s metafile on github and link?>>. 

Effect sizes have been determined with reference to early national and international literature on the Covid-19 pandemic and similar previous one-off events or epidemics e.g. SARS, MERS, Boston Marathon lockdown. We accept this has become out-of-date quite quickly. <<host the evidence metafile on github and link?>>  

The flow variables in our model are determined by empirical data extracted from the national Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS). 

The mapping of likely flows of conditions to services was initially developed in conjunction with a multi-disciplinary team from Mersey Care Foundation NHS Trust. 

## Flow and pathway variables explained 

In order for our simplification of the mental health pathway to reflect near-reality we have chosen to introduce several variables across our model: 

| Variable | Description | Derivation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Referrals receiving service | Not all patients referred will receive a treatment, some will not meet thresholds and others may refuse or drop-out before treatment begins. | MHSDS tables MHS101, MHS102 and MHS201 or IAPT V1.5. All completed referrals made during 2018. % of those that had a clinical contact after the date of referral and were not discharged before treatment began. | 
| Time in treatment | The length of time (in months) that patients in each service stay on caseload. Implemented here as a 50% decay function. | MHSDS tables MHS101, MHS102. All completed referrals made during 2018. Median whole months between referral and discharge dates for each service. |
| Treatment success | The likelihood that patients will require further treatment after discharged from current service. |  MHSDS tables MHS101, MHS102. All completed referrals made during 2018. % of patients discharged that were referred to any mental health team within 12 months of discharge (or re-admission for inpatient services). |
| Demand multiplier | The intensity of service provided for patients in each service. Could relate to any aspect of care activity – OP appointments, community contacts, inpatient beddays. | MHSDS tables MHS101, MHS102, MHS201, MHS501 or IAPT v1.5. All completed referrals made during 2018. Count of clinical care contact days (clinical care contact time > 0 or IAPT therapy sessions) between dates of referral and discharge. Calculated as units per patient per month. |
